## Final Project: BWYE('Burn What You Eat') || BurntFood

#### General Assembly, New York

#### Objectives: Recipe search app and an exercise to burn the calories

<br>
#### Idea

Its simple... I think. This app will let you search over 1 million recipes through the Yummly API that match your ingredient criteria. This is a great idea if you're someone who cannot think of exciting recipes on the fly but know the types of ingredients you like to eat. As another added feature ontop, if you decide to select a recipe to cook, the app will give you an exercise which will equally burn the amount of calories you just ate.

#### Development thoughts

- profile creation on sign up
- exercises linked to recipes
- if recipe is deleted, so is the exercise
- figure out weekly/monthly stats
- show total exercises achieved + calories burnt
- total calories eaten, perhaps over a weekly/month period, how to grab this data?


#### Third-party applications

- Yummly Recipe Search API
